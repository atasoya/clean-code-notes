We would like a source file to be like a newspaper article. At the top you expect a headline that will tell you what the story is about and allows you to decide whether it is something you want to read.

### Vertical formatting:
- Files should be short
- Place related code close together
### Horizontal Formatting:
- Keep lines short
- Horizontal spacing to group related items

*The code formatting you choose is less important than the consistency of the formatting.*
