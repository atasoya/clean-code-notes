### Working with Unknown Code
Using lerning tests is fast and zero cost way to get familiar with external codes.
### Tests for external API's
Tests for external API's are greatly important as we can make sure that error is from our code or from the API. Also at any point in time if external API changes we can test if it breaks any of our features.
### Using wrappers
Creating wrappers for third party libraries allows our code to stay stable. This makes changing the package easier in the future if needed.
