# Clean Code Notes

![Clean Code Book Cover](./clean-code-book-cover.png)

After graduating with my degree in computer engineering, I decided it was time to deepen my software development skills. This book had been on my mind for ages, so I finally committed to finishing it. As I read, I took small notes both to reinforce what I learned and to help anyone else who might find these summaries useful :))
