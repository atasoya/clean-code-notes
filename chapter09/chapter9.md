Tests are essential part of the clean code.

### Three Laws of Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Don't write production code unless it's to make failing unit test pass.
- Write only enough of a unit test to fail
- Write only enough production code to make test pass.
### Clean & Readible
Test must be clean just like the production code and also it must be readible
### F.I.R.S.T Criteria
- Fast - Test must run quick 
- Independent - Tests should not depend on each other
- Repeatable - Yields same result everytime
- Self-Validating - Output is either pass or fail
- **Timely - Test should be written just before the production code.**
