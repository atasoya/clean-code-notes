### Classes also should be small
Just like functions, but here by small we are not mentioning actual lines of code here small means **responsibility**

### SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
Every class should do **one thing**(responsibility) and do it well.

### Golden Rule
If you canâ€™t describe what a class does in a short sentence, it probably does too much.
