**Good names make code readible and maintainable. Bad naming hides the programmer's intent.**

### Key Guidelines for Naming:
- Use intention revealing names
- Avoid confusing names (Personal information is not PI)
- Have meaningful distinctions (dont use data1, data2, data3)
- All names must be readible & pronounceable
- Use searchable names 
- Follow conventions
- Avoid encoding (us new developers don't know this but old developers used to name variables like `stringName`)

*If you have to add a comment to explain the name, change the name instead.*
